<!-- Engagement Model -->
<section id="engagement">
  <h2>Engagement Model</h2>
  <p>Our offerings are rooted in carefully structured engagements designed to align with your objectives, protect the value of intellectual assets, and deliver durable outcomes. All access is provided through a consultation-first process.</p>
  <p>We do not offer general-access APIs, demo portals, or open codebases. Instead, we work closely with clients to scope, refine, and integrate systems that are built to endure.</p>

  <h3>üîç Access by Engagement</h3>
  <p>We assess not just technical feasibility, but strategic fit ‚Äî ensuring our tools and methods serve your architecture, team structure, and timelines effectively.</p>
  <blockquote><em>"All capabilities are provided through tailored engagement. This ensures alignment with client-specific needs and protects the depth of our intellectual property."</em></blockquote>

  <h3>üìê Engagement Pathways</h3>

  <div class="tile">
    <h4>1. Exploratory Consultation</h4>
    <p>A strategic discussion to clarify your challenges, constraints, and ambitions. We assess alignment and outline possible engagement directions.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Problem framing, fit analysis, and next-step recommendations.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tile">
    <h4>2. Technical Systems Review</h4>
    <p>We conduct a diagnostic of your systems or models to identify opportunities for structured integration or abstraction.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Implementation pathways, system insight, and risk clarification.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tile">
    <h4>3. Library Alignment & Licensing</h4>
    <p>When appropriate, we license access to core mathematical tools ‚Äî tailored to your technical environment and adapted for intended usage.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Structured access to core tools under a bespoke agreement.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tile">
    <h4>4. Custom Solutions Development</h4>

<!-- About -->
<section id="about">
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>We build mathematical systems for the world behind the interface ‚Äî where structure, logic, and performance converge to support durable, intelligent computation.</p>

  <h3>üéØ Our Mission</h3>
  <p><strong>To provide precision mathematics engineered for modern systems.</strong></p>
  <p>We believe that foundational tools ‚Äî when deliberately designed ‚Äî elevate entire systems. Our goal is to bring clarity to complexity, coherence to systems, and structure to abstraction.</p>

  <h3>üåê What We Build</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Structural</strong> ‚Äì Tools that anchor and reinforce system architecture</li>
    <li><strong>Interpretable</strong> ‚Äì Formal methods that can be trusted, reviewed, and explained</li>
    <li><strong>Performant</strong> ‚Äì Efficient under load, resilient under transformation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not treat our domains (optimization, logic, modeling) as verticals. We treat them as unified expressions of deeper form.</p>

  <h3>üîç Our Orientation</h3>
  <p>We are not a product company. We do not publish feature lists or demo tools.</p>
  <p>We are a precision partner ‚Äî focused on supporting critical systems with foundational design and rigorous logic.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Depth before distribution</li>
    <li>Alignment before access</li>
    <li>Systemic clarity before surface features</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üå± The Vision Forward</h3>
  <p>As systems become more abstract, interdependent, and opaque, the need for transparent, principled foundations becomes more urgent.</p>
  <blockquote><strong>We are building the infrastructure layer for computational clarity ‚Äî one system at a time.</strong></blockquote>
